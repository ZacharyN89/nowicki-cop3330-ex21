/*
Exercise 21 - Numbers to Names

Many programs display information to the end user in one form but use a different form inside the program. For example, you may show the word Blue on the screen, but behind the scenes youâ€™ll have a numerical value for that color or an internal value because you may need to represent the textual description in another language for Spanish-speaking visitors.

Write a program that converts a number from 1 to 12 to the corresponding month. Prompt for a number and display the corresponding calendar month, with 1 being January and 12 being December. For any value outside that range, display an appropriate error message.
Example Output

Please enter the number of the month: 3
The name of the month is March.

Constraints

    Use a switch or case statement for this program.
    Use a single output statement for this program.

Challenges

    Use a map or dictionary to remove the switch statement from the program.
    Support multiple languages. Prompt for the language at the beginning of the program.
